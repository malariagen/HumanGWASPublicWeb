<h2>'Find [@Snp]' wizard</h2>

This wizard uses several methods to search for [@snps] of interest in the [@organismshort] genome:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Select from a list of known [@resistmarkers]</b><br />
Select a particular [@snp] from a list of loci associated with drug resistance. The list only contains those [@snps] called in this data set. Click 'Finish' to open a pop-up with more information on the selected [@snp].
</li>

<li>
<b>Search by [@snp] ID</b><br />
Each variant called in this data set is assigned a unique identifier composed of the chromosome and position (<b>chromosome:position</b>, e.g. MAL7:459003). To search by variant ID, enter the ID (chromosome:position) in the input box and click 'Finish'. If a [@snp] in this data set has been assigned this ID, a pop-up with more information on the selected [@snp] will appear. If this data set does not contain a [@snp] with this ID, an 'Invalid [@snp] ID' pop-up will appear.
</li>

<li>
<b>Search by gene</b><br />
Search for a [@snp] in two steps:
<ol>
<li>Select a gene in the [@organismshort] genome by specifying a keyword or partial keyword that is matched against the gene name and description. If the search returns a list of matches, select the gene of interest and click 'Next'.</li>
<li>Within that gene, select a [@snp] from the list of [@snps] called in this gene. Click 'Finish' to open a pop-up with more information on the selected [@snp].</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<b>Search by genomic region</b><br />
Select a chromosome from the drop-down list, and specify a start and stop position in base pairs. The wizard will display a list of all [@snps] within this region. Select a specific [@snp] from this list and click 'Finish' to open a pop-up with more information on the selected [@snp].
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recent hits</h4>
This section lists the search results returned by the 'Find [@snp]' wizard during the active session. The hits are listed by [@snp] ID; click on an ID to open the info pop-up for that [@snp].

<h3>[@Snp] info pop-ups</h3>
Upon completing a successful search, an info pop-up will appear with basic information about the selected [@snp]: 
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Type</li>
<li>Gene identifier</li>
<li>Gene names</li>
<li>Reference allele</li>
<li>Non-reference allele</li>
<li>Ancestral allele</li>
<li>Reference allele</li>
<li>Population frequencies for non-reference allele (NRAF), derived allele (DAF), minor allele (MAF)</li>
</ul>
A set of buttons leads to different views, each visualising data about the [@snp]:
<ul>
<li>The position on the genome</li>
<li>Map of allele frequencies</li>
<li>Info pop-up for the gene contatining this [@snp]</li>
</ul>
